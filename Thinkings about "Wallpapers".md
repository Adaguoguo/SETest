                                                       A small Application
  I have used an application named "Wallpapers" for a long time , it has a great deal of 1080HD pictures which were available to beused as wallpaper.It's very easy to know how to use it , you can search all kinds of wallpaper as you can imagine. To tell the truth, it brings convinience to all of users exactly, there are many advantages that should be rewarded.But its disadvantages ar
also much too obvious.It didn't change its old things.A software would never be successful if it doesn't make the progress 
happened.So I summarized some disadvantages I have found for years.


  First of all ,the interface of the program is too simple.It's so simple that even made me want to delect it.Nowadays ,APPs 
optimize their own interface as beautiful as they can , Wallpapers becomes lacking of competitiveness.More and more new users 
will give it up ,only few fans insist using it.\


  Second, it will use your GPRS data if you don't link to the Wifi without your permission.As we know,the HD pictures take up 
large storge, downloading needs a lot data.That means you can only browse several wallpapers after paying much.It's just a 
little detail, but sometimes it would leave a terrible impression to the users.This is the key to the success or failure.


  Last one , and also the most important one--Search Engines are not intelligent!This affect the experience of the users greatly.Sometimes you just want a wallpaper of animation, but the results only give you many picture of scenery. I've been in this situation many times.If I were a new user , I must have delect it and will not download it any more.
  
  
  Those are my opnions, wish the Wallpapers could be a good APP as I imagined.
