                                                       A small Application
  I have been using an application named "Wallpapers" for a long time. It has a great deal of 1080HD pictures which were available to be used as wallpapers.It's very easy to learn how to use it. With this app, you can search all kinds of wallpapers as you can imagine. To tell the truth, it do brings convinience to all of its users. It has many advantages that should be rewarded, but its disadvantages are also much too obvious.It doesn't change its old things.A software would never be successful if it doesn't make progress.Therefore, I summarized some disadvantages I have found for years.


  First of all ,the interface of the program is too simple.It's too simple that it even makes me want to delect it.Nowadays ,APPs optimize their own interface as beautifully as they can, so "Wallpapers" becomes lack of competitiveness.More and more new users will give it up ,but only few fans will insist on using it.


  Second, when your phone is not linked to Wifi, it will use your GPRS data without your permission.As we know,the HD pictures take up large storge. Consequently, downloading needs a lot of data.This means you can only browse several wallpapers while paying much.It's just a detail, but sometimes it would leave a terrible impression to the users.This is the key to success or failure.


  Last but not least--Searching Engines are not intelligent!This affects the experience of the users greatly.Sometimes you just want a wallpaper of animation, but the searching result only gives you many pictures of scenery. I've been in this situation for many times.If I were a new user, I must have delected it and would not download it any more.
  
  
  Those are my opnions, wish "Wallpapers" could be as good an APP as I imagine.
